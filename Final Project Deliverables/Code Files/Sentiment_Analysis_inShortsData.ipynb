The politics, the lies and false narratives finally got me! You win … I\\'m out.\"\\n\\nRepresentatives for Roach did not immediately respond to Insider\\'s request for comment on the stylist\\'s retirement. However, Roach spoke to Insider in February about the impact styling has had on him, and his love for fashion was clear.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\"Styling is like a drug for me when I know I get it right,\" he told Insider. \"Whoever I\\'m dressing, when they have that extra little thing — a little spark or a little wiggle in their walk — I just love that feeling.\"\\n\\nFans, celebrities, and fellow stylists were quick to comment on Roach\\'s post sharing their support and urging him to reconsider. Country singer Maren Morris left a broken-heart emoji, and fashion designer Christian Siriano wrote \"Absolutely not.\"\\n\\n\"Law I won\\'t let you!!!!\" Naomi Campbell added. \"We don\\'t quit...strived too hard.\"\\n\\nIn the days leading up to Roach\\'s post, the stylist had been widely praised for his recent red-carpet work.\\n\\nHe styled Zendaya in a stunning, rose-embellished gown at the SAG Awards, and dressed Kerry Washington in one of Whitney Houston\\'s gowns for the American Black Film Festival.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nVALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nHe also dressed numerous stars for the Vanity Fair Oscars after-party on Sunday, including Megan Thee Stallion, Hunter Schafer, and Eve Jobs.'"

              "'Bigg Boss OTT fame Urfi Javed lashed out at popular Marathi actress Sonali Kulkarni for her recent statements on gender equality at an event.\\n\\nFor those unversed, Sonali\\'s video has gone viral in which she says that some women demand for a husband with a good job, house and other luxuries, but refuse to work themselves. She also urged families to encourage and educate their daughters and make them capable enough that they can take care of their own expenses.\\n\\nUrfi lashes out Sonali Kulkarni\\n\\nReacting to Sonali\\'s now-viral video, Urfi slammed the actress for calling modern day women lazy. She also asked what\\'s wrong in wanting a husband whose earning good.\\n\\nUrfi wrote on Twitter, \"How insensitive, whatever you said! You’re calling modern day women lazy when they are handling their work as well as household chores together? What’s wrong in wanting a husband whose earning good?\"\\n\\nShe added, \"Men for centuries only saw women as child vending machine and yes the main reason for marriage - dowry. Ladies don’t be afraid to ask or demand. Yes you’re right women should work but that’s a privilege that not everyone gets. You’re too entitled to see that may be.\"\\n\\nWhat did Sonali say during the event?\\n\\nIn the video, Sonali said, \"In India, there are a lot of women who are just lazy. They want a husband who has a good job, own house, guaranteed increments, but they do not know what they want to do for themselves. I want to advice everyone that encourage the women of your house and make them capable enough that they can fend for themselves, who can share the household expenses with her partner.\"\\n\\nShe also extended her support to men and said that in the Indian society, they feel more pressure than women to start earning for the family as soon as they turn 18. \"Not all women are like that. But this aggression and this demanding nature has been growing quite a lot. We need to see the situation with humbleness and equality. Paying bills and buying groceries should not be restricted to men only,\" she said.\\n\\nAbout Sonali Kulkarni and Urfi Javed\\n\\nSonali has been a part of several hit Hindi and Marathi films. Besides, she has also been a part of Kannada, Tamil, Gujarati and English films. In Bollywood, Sonali has acted in films like \\'Dil Chahta Hai\\', \\'Singham\\', \\'Poster Boys\\', and others.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Urfi often makes headlines for her fashion choices and bold opinions. She is known for her work in shows such as \\'Bade Bhaiyya Ki Dulhania\\', \\'Meri Durga\\', \\'Bepannaah\\' and \\'Puncch Beat Season 2\\'.\\n\\n(To receive our E-paper on WhatsApp daily, please click here.
